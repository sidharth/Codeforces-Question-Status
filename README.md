# Codeforces-Question-Status

A Simple Chrome Extension for use while practicing questions in Codeforces.

It simply matches the Active Tab URL to the standard Codeforces Problemset template, and if a match is found
then it opens a new tab for the "Problem Status" where you can view the solutions that others have submitted.
